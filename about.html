      Vegetarian Gardens Inc. was established in 1995 in
      Georgetown, Guyana, South America.  Today, it is Guyana's
      largest importer and distributor of vegetarian and health
      food products. Our products include all types of dried,
      frozen and canned soy products, natural beverages, oils
      and condiments. These products are available in all leading
      supermarkets, groceries, open markets, mom & pop shops
      and mini-marts. The family's value for healthy eating
      has become the core value of the company.<br>
      Vegetarian Gardens Inc. is steadily growing; we currently
      have more than 20 employees. In 2010, the company gave the
      distribution rights of its private label of dry soya meats
      to Marketing & Distribution Inc. (Guyana), a member of the
      Neal & Massey Group. Vegetarian Gardens Inc. will also
      launch Guyana's first health food supermarket, full scale
      vegetarian restaurant and distribution outlet in 2010.
